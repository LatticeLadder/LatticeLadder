> I didn’t exactly get a clear answer out of that experience, but I did make up my mind about something for myself. It was that movies aren’t school textbooks. Maybe I should have realized earlier, but I had a renewed awareness that movies (or, more broadly, entertainment) don’t need to be “correct” or set an example. On the contrary, **they should talk about the things textbooks can’t discuss, such as our secret wishes that others would frown upon if they knew**. I decided I'd say things that textbooks didn’t say, that politicians didn’t say, that critics didn’t say. I'd create stories on a different level from morals and education. That’s my job, after all, and if it gets me in trouble with someone, well, that’s how it goes.
